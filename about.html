<p> My self Manisha Solanki. I was born in 2002. I am an artist and an art Instructor.</p>
<p>I started mandala work at a very young age, then my interest grew deeper in that. Since, my childhood I use "Nakshi" as my art name.</p>
<p> I used to do madala art forms as a hobby first. And, later when I made plenty of them, thought to share with the people.</p>
<p>Here on the website I kept some of my collection for sale. If you like my work and wanna see more you can visit my studio, the details are at the bottom of your screen.</p>
